        Nature showcases small organisms with remarkable individual locomotion and collective behaviors â€“ from hummingbirds demonstrating great agility and precise hovering, to schools of fish navigating thousands of miles in adaptive group patterns. Imagine replicating such feats with swarms of small robots.

        My research draws inspiration from biological systems to overcome the challenges in miniaturize robotic swarms. I aim to develop cost-effective, small-scale robots for practical applications, such as exploring cluttered environments, monitoring ecosystems, and gathering high-resolution ocean observations.
